# Code Online - Real-Time Collaborative Coding Platform

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

A LeetCode-inspired platform for real-time code mentoring sessions, built with Next.js and WebSocket technology. The platform enables mentors to observe and guide students through coding challenges in real-time.

üîó [Live Demo](https://online-coding-frontend.onrender.com) (Note: Initial load may take around 1 minute due to cold start)

## Features

### üè† Home Page
- Collection of coding challenges with varying difficulty levels (inserted manually)
